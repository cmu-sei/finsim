	What is allowed

	You may use icons in personal or commercial projects, repeatedly and you do not need to buy an extra license for every new project.

	What is not allowed

	You cannot use icons in any product intended for further processing or where your customer is not a final owner. It is strictly prohibited to bundle icons in any HTML themes, frameworks, as a library of shapes/images or wherever icons would generate a significant value of the final product.

	Also, it isn't possible to use them on a product where the icons would be used repeatedly in larger series. For example as prints of t-shirts, mugs, posters or any other product which have a character of repeated production.

	It is not allowed to resell the icons (license) as such, because the icons remain the intellectual property of the author.

	Any other use must be approved in writing. It is not possible to request any changes in this license before or after the purchase.

	If customer violates any terms and conditions in this license, it will terminate this license automatically.
